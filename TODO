 * Think about parametrizing endpoints urls, and allow get(EndpointType, **kwargs),
   computing the endpoint url from the parameters, and returning the good object.

   This would avoid having to pass a type collection to the client too, 
   This would allow to remove the get(url) method, replacing it with get(EndPoint, parameters)
